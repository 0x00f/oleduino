OLEDuino
--------

A cheap electronic name badge that can be programmed with the arduino ide. 
The ATMEGA 328 has to be preloaded with the Arduino Pro 8Mhz 3.3V bootloader.
Also chose that board when programming the badge with a 3.3V FTDI board.

* A source for the OLED: Search eBay for "128X64 OLED module" and pick the cheapest one with the 7 pin header on top
* A source for a battery: Any small 3.7V lithium polymer battery will do (like the ones for small RC helicopters)
