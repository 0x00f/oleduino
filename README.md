OLEDuino
--------

An interactive badge. The ATMEGA 328 has to be preloaded with the Arduino Pro 8Mhz 3.3V bootloader.

A source for the OLED: Search eBay for "128X64 OLED module" and pick the cheapest one with the 7 pin header on top
A source for a battery: Any small 3.7 lithium polymer will do (like the ones for small RC helicopters)
